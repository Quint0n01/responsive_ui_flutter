# responsive_ui

This responsive UI project automatically detects the screen size and device orientation, and adjust the view according to that. 

This allows you to have separate design and layouts for your app for every screen size and orientation. 

Code is written for Mobile Portrait View, Mobile Landscape View, Tablet Portrait View, Tablet Landscape View, and Desktop View.
